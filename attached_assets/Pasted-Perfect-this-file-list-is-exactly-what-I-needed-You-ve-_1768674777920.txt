Perfect — this file list is exactly what I needed.
You’ve actually done 80% of the work already ✅

Now I’ll explain precisely what to do next, using your current Replit files, with no guessing.

✅ What Your Current File Structure Tells Us

From your screenshot, I can see:

✅ dist/ already exists at the ROOT
✅ This means npm run build was successful
✅ GitHub Pages can work with this
❌ But the dist contents are not exposed correctly yet

Right now your structure is:

/
├── client/
├── dist/              ✅ (GOOD)
├── server/
├── shared/
├── SwimPortfolio/
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts


⚠️ Important rule
GitHub Pages does NOT automatically open the dist folder.
It looks for:

/index.html


at the root, not inside /dist.

🎯 GOAL (Very Important)

We must make GitHub Pages see the built site.

You have two correct options.
I strongly recommend OPTION A (clean & correct).

✅ OPTION A (RECOMMENDED): Tell GitHub Pages to Use /dist

This is the best practice and does not require moving files.

Step A1: Go to GitHub Pages settings

Open your repo on GitHub

Go to Settings → Pages

Step A2: Change the folder

Under Build and deployment:

Source: Deploy from a branch

Branch: main

Folder: /dist ⬅️ CHANGE THIS

Click Save

⏳ Wait 30–60 seconds

Step A3: Open your site
https://nexiohub.github.io/SwimPortfoliomain/


🎉 Your site should now load.

🧪 If You Want to Verify (Optional)

Inside dist/, you MUST have:

dist/
 ├── index.html   ✅ REQUIRED
 ├── assets/


If index.html is missing → build again:

npm run build

⚠️ OPTION B (NOT RECOMMENDED, BUT WORKS)

Move files from dist/ to root.

Why I don’t recommend it

Messy repo

Harder to update

Easy to break later

But for learning, yes, it works.

❗ VERY IMPORTANT NOTE (Backend Warning)

Your repo contains:

server/


That WILL NOT RUN on GitHub Pages.

Feature	Works on GitHub Pages
HTML / CSS / JS	✅
Vite build output	✅
Node server	❌
API routes	❌
Database	❌

If your frontend depends on backend APIs → pages will load but features may fail.

✅ FINAL CHECKLIST (Follow This Order)

✔ dist/ exists
✔ dist/index.html exists
✔ GitHub Pages folder set to /dist
✔ Wait 1 minute
✔ Refresh site
